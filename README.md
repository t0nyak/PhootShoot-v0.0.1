# PhootShoot

A browser game based on real player statistics on each match. Hierarchy of leagues (each level is supported by 3 new leagues from 1 lower level). These hierarchies belong to each country, in order to be able later to play some special competitions (like World Championships, Champion Leagues, etc.). The objective is to get a big community from different countries, to become something similar to a eSport. Future goals: Advanced UI with real matches and players controlled by humans.
